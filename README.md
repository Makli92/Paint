# Paint

BasePaint project is a Java-implemented custom paint program. Apart from choosing the draw pad's dimensions, the user can not only draw 
the basic shapes (like Line, Circle, Triangle, Square, Rectangular, Crooked Line, Polygons (4 or 5 sides)), but also fill them. The 
shapes are all shaved in an arraylist, and can be modified from the drop-down list on the right of the GUI. It is noted that the 
polygons' filling works according to the scan-line polygon fill algorithm (the link is mentioned inside the DOCUMENTATION.pdf).
